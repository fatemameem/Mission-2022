          Hello! My name is Fatema Ahsan Meem. I am a freshly graduated student
          of BRAC University. Besides reading fiction in my free time, these
          days I mostly focus on learning about web development. As a beginner,
          I have created various projects using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla
          JavaScript. I am currently learning about React.js and Node.js. I am
          also learning about Python and Django.

            <h3>Mission</h3>
            <p>
              After trying my hand with Python and Java, I decided to learn
              about web development in order to expand my area of expertises. I
              had decided to enroll for Complete Web Development course by
              Programming Hero last year, but due to the lack of time, I decided
              to enroll for the same course in 2022.

            <h3>Vision</h3>
            <p>
              This year, I want to learn how to create a website properly, and
              how to manage it like a professional. I am also trying to go
              abroad for continuing my further studies in CSE. I plan to improve
              both my personal and professional skills. Hopefully this will be
              the year I will be able to achieve all!

            <h3>Goals</h3>
            <p>
              My short term goal involves getting a job with whatever skills I
              have for now. My long term goal is to learn more about web
              development and become a full stack developer. It has been one of
              my dreams to be able to work in a reputed company like Google.

          <h2>Marvel Hangman Game</h2>
          <p>
            This is a simple hangman game I made using vanilla JavaScript. I
            learned how to use the DOM and how to create a new element using
            JavaScript. I also learned how to use the event listener to listen
            for a click event. I also learned how to use the prompt to get a
            user input. I also learned how to use the alert to display messages.
            I created this game by watching a YouTube video on how to create a
            hangman game by Ania Kubow.

          <h2>Restaurant Management</h2>
          <p>
            This was my project for the Software Engineering course. I created a
            restaurant management system using JavaFX, JavaSE, MySQL, and Scene
            Builder. I also performed tests to check whether the system is
            working properly and I created a report to show the performance of
            the system. This project was a great experience for me as I got a
            taste of how a system is developed in the industrial world.
